## SEB - STRING SLICING

### AIM  
To write a Python function that accepts a string and forms a new string by reversing the characters from the **2th position to the 7th position** with **alternate characters**, and then prints the new string.

### ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.
2. Read a string input from the user and store it in `input_string`.
3. Define a function `slice(input_string)` that:
4. Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM
```
Reg.No: 212223060266
Name: Snega G

def slice(input_string):
    sliced_string = input_string[2:7]
    print(f"The sliced string is '{sliced_string}'")
```

### RESULT
Thus a Python function that accepts a string and forms a new string by reversing the characters from the 2th position to the 7th position with alternate characters, and then prints the new string was executed and implemented successfully.
